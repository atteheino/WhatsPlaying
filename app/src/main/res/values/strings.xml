        I developed this appliction to fit my own needs. Hope it works for you also. Feedback is appreciated!\n\n

        In order for WhatsPlaying to know what is playing in Spotify, you need to activate broadcasts in Spotify app settings:\n\n
        (Open Spotify => Settings =>  Activate: "Device broadcast status - allow other apps on your device to see what you are listening to")\n\n
